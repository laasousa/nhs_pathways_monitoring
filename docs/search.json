These data include all reports classified as ‘potential COVID-19 cases’ notified via calls to 111, 999, and 111-online systems. These data are not confirmed cases, and are subject to unknown reporting biases. They likely include a substantial fraction of ‘false positives’ (cases classified as potential COVID-19 which are in fact due to other illness), as well as under-reporting (true COVID-19 cases not reported). Last, as these data are using self-reporting, it is likely that individual perceptions as well as ease of access to the reporting platforms impact the observed numbers.\r\nFor a discussion of how these data can be interpreted and associated caveats, see this article (under review). A shorter version can be found online on this post.\r\nData source\r\nThe NHS pathways data used on this website are publicly available from the NHS dashboard and stored with a folder in Thibaut Jombart’s repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This new algorithm has not been peer reviewed yet.\r\nASMODEE in a nutshell\r\nASMODEE aims to detect recent deviation from the trend followed by the data in time series. Data is first partitioned into ‘recent’ data, using the last ‘k’ observations as supplementary individuals, and older data used to fit the trend. Trend-fitting is done by fitting a series of user-specified models for the time series, with different methods for selecting best fit (see details, and the argument ‘method’). The prediction interval is then calculated for the best model, and every data point (including the training set and supplementary individuals) falling outside are classified as ‘outliers’. The value of ‘k’ can be fixed by the user, or automatically selected to minimise outliers in the training period and maximise and the detection of outliers in the recent period.\r\nImplementation\r\nR package trendbreaker\r\nASMODEE is implemented in the R package trendbreaker, hosted by the R Epidemics Consortium.\r\nTry it out\r\nYou can install trendbreaker from R by typing:\r\nif (!require(remotes)) {\r\n  install.packages(\"remotes\")\r\n}\r\nremotes::install_github(\"reconhub/trendbreaker\")\r\nContributions\r\nThis package is still under development. Contributions are most welcome. A good place to start would be to look at the current issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These analyses are broken down by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG). Only the last 6 weeks of data are used.

These analyses are broken down by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG). Only the last 6 weeks of data are used. The last week of data is not used to define the temporal trend so that recent outliers can be detected.\r\nNote: this research has not been peer-reviewed yet. This website is still experimental. Please contact the authors before using its content.\r\nlinear regression with a linear time effect\r\nPoisson GLMs\r\nconstant\r\nwith log-linear time effect\r\nwith log-linear time effect and weekend effect (weekend / monday / other day)\r\nwith log-linear time effect and weekday effect\r\n\r\nNegative Binomial GLMs\r\nconstant\r\nwith log-linear time effect\r\nwith log-linear time effect and weekend effect (weekend / monday / other day)\r\nwith log-linear time effect and weekday effect\r\n\r\nAnalyses are run separately for each CCG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults: 111/999 calls and 111-online.\r\nThese analyses use calls to 111 and 999, as well as NHS 111-online reports of potential COVID-19 cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrend changes over the last week: overview\r\nThis graph provides an overview of the numbers of increases/decreases detected at a CCG level by ASMODEE over the last week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCCG by numbers of outliers\r\nThe following graph shows ASMODEE results ordered by decreasing amounts of outliers in the last 7 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable summary for all CCGs\r\nThis table summarises the numbers of changes detected by ASMODEE over the last 7 days, broken down into increases and decreases. prob is the probability of observing that many outliers in the last week under the best fitting model, given the chosen alpha threshold (5%).\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"top\",\"filterHTML\":\"<tr>\\n  <td data-type=\\\"character\\\" style=\\\"vertical-align: top;\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group has-feedback\\\"
