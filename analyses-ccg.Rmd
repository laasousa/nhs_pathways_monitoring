```

Using the new algorithm ASMODEE (**A**utomatic **S**election of **M**odels and
**O**utlier **D**etection for **E**pidemics) we monitor changes in potential
COVID-19 cases reported through the [NHS
pathways](https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/nhs-pathways), including calls to
111, 999, and 111-online. These analyses are broken down by Clinical
Commissioning Groups [(CCG)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/ccgs/). Only the last 6
weeks of data are used. The last week of data is not used to define the temporal
trend so that recent outliers can be detected.

Analyses are run separately for each CCG.

## Results: 111/999 calls and 111-online.

These analyses use calls to 111 and 999, as well as NHS 111-online reports of
potential COVID-19 cases.

```{r results_ccg_calls}

# analyses by CCG

## get count by CCG
counts_ccg_all <- incidence(
  pathways_recent,
  date_index = date,
  count = count,
  groups = ccg_name
)

# add on day and weekday
counts_ccg_all <- counts_ccg_all %>%
  mutate(day_type = day_of_week(date_index),
         weekday = weekdays(date_index))



## run asmodee on all CCGs
## note: this takes about 1 minute to run with AIC model selection,
## around 16-17 min with cross validation

### Trend changes over the last week: overview

This graph provides an overview of the numbers of increases/decreases detected
at a CCG level by ASMODEE over the last week.

```{r ccg_outliers_summary, out_width = "50%"}

ccg_outliers_summary <- ccg_all_stats %>%
  mutate(n_recent_increase = factor(n_recent_increase, levels = 0:7),
         n_recent_decrease = factor(n_recent_decrease, levels = 0:7)) %>%
  group_by(n_recent_increase, n_recent_decrease) %>%
  count() %>%
  rename(increase = n_recent_increase,
         decrease = n_recent_decrease,
         frequency = n) %>%
  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = "change", values_to = "n")

ccg_outliers_summary  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = frequency, fill = change)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual("Change over last week",
                    values = c(increase = "#B26363", decrease = "#93bca8")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Number of days showing trend change last week",
       y = "Number of CCGs",
       title = "Trend changes detected by ASMODEE") +

### CCG by numbers of outliers

The following graph shows ASMODEE results ordered by decreasing amounts of
outliers in the last 7 days.

```{r echo = FALSE}

n_figs <- length(res_ccg_all)

```

```{r plots_all, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 2 * round(n_figs / 3), out.width = "100%", dpi = 50} 

## reorder ccgs
ccg_order <- ccg_all_stats %>%
  filter(ccg != "null") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_recent_increase),
          desc(n_outliers_recent)) %>%
  pull(ccg)

oclass <- class(res_ccg_all)
res_ccg_all <- res_ccg_all[ccg_order]
names(res_ccg_all) <- sub("nhs_", "", names(res_ccg_all))
class(res_ccg_all) <- oclass

## plot results for top ccg
plot(res_ccg_all, ncol = 3)

```

### Table summary for all CCGs

This table summarises the numbers of changes detected by ASMODEE over the last 7
days, broken down into increases and decreases. *prob* is the probability of
observing that many outliers in the last week under the best fitting model,
given the chosen alpha threshold (5%).

```{r ccg_all_table, results = "markup"}

## display table
ccg_all_stats %>%
  mutate(prob = format.pval(p_value, digits = 3),
         ccg = gsub("_", " ", ccg),
         ccg = gsub("nhs", "NHS", ccg)) %>%
  select(ccg,
         changes = n_outliers_recent,
         increase = n_recent_increase,
         decrease = n_recent_decrease,
         p_value) %>%
  DT::datatable(ccg_all_stats,
                rownames = FALSE,
                width = "100%",
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = 'top')

```
