<p>Using the new algorithm ASMODEE (<strong>A</strong>utomatic <strong>S</strong>election of <strong>M</strong>odels and
<strong>O</strong>utlier <strong>D</strong>etection for <strong>E</strong>pidemics) we monitor changes in potential
COVID-19 cases reported through the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/nhs-pathways">NHS
pathways</a>, including calls to
111, 999, and 111-online. These analyses are broken down by Clinical
Commissioning Groups <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ccgs/">(CCG)</a>. Only the last 6
weeks of data are used. The last week of data is not used to define the temporal
trend so that recent outliers can be detected.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this research has not been peer-reviewed yet. This website is still
experimental. Please contact the <a
href="mailto:thibautjombart@gmail.com">authors</a> before using its content.</p>
<p>Models considered here for trend fitting include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>linear regression of counts over time</p></li>
<li><p>Poisson GLM with a constant rate</p></li>
<li><p>Negative Binomial GLM with a log-linear effect of time</p></li>
<li><p>Negative Binomial GLM with a log-linear effect of time and a ‘weekday’ effect
distinguishing weekends, Mondays, and the rest of the week</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Analyses are run separately for each CCG.</p>
<div id="results-111999-calls-and-111-online." class="section level2">
<h2>Results: 111/999 calls and 111-online.</h2>
<p>These analyses use calls to 111 and 999, as well as NHS 111-online reports of
potential COVID-19 cases. Only CCGs with at least 10 cases in the training set
are used in the analyses, as time series with lower counts currently cause
errors in some of the model candidates. This will be addressed in further
improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/reconhub/trending/issues/10"><em>trending</em></a>
package.</p>

<h3>Trend changes over the last week: overview</h3>
<p>This graph provides an overview of the numbers of increases/decreases detected
at a CCG level by ASMODEE over the last week.</p>

<h3>Top 20 CCG</h3>
<p>These plots show the 20 CGGs with the most increases in the last 7 days. This

<div id="table-summary-for-all-ccgs" class="section level3">
<h3>Table summary for all CCGs</h3>
<p>This table summarises the numbers of changes detected by ASMODEE over the last 7
days, broken down into increases and decreases. <em>prob</em> is the probability of
observing that many outliers in the last week under the best fitting model,
given the chosen alpha threshold (5%).</p>
