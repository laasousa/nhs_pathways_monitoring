<p>Using the new algorithm ASMODEE (<strong>A</strong>utomatic <strong>S</strong>election of <strong>M</strong>odels and
<strong>O</strong>utlier <strong>D</strong>etection for <strong>E</strong>pidemics) we monitor changes in potential
COVID-19 cases reported through the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/nhs-pathways">NHS
pathways</a>, including calls to
111, 999, and 111-online. These analyses are broken down by Clinical
Commissioning Groups <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ccgs/">(CCG)</a>. Only the last 6
weeks of data are used. The last week of data is not used to define the temporal
trend so that recent outliers can be detected.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this research has not been peer-reviewed yet. This website is still
experimental. Please contact the <a
href="mailto:thibautjombart@gmail.com">authors</a> before using its content.</p>
<p>Models considered here for trend fitting include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>linear regression of counts over time</p></li>
<li><p>Poisson GLM with a constant rate</p></li>
<li><p>Negative Binomial GLM with a log-linear effect of time</p></li>
<li><p>Negative Binomial GLM with a log-linear effect of time and a ‘weekday’ effect
distinguishing weekends, Mondays, and the rest of the week</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Analyses are run separately for each CCG.</p>
<div id="results-111999-calls" class="section level2">
<h2>Results: 111/999 calls</h2>
<p>Recent observations suggest that 111/999 calls may be more reflective of actual
dynamics than 111-online. Therefore, this section only shows analyses based on
these data. See next section for results using the whole dataset, i.e. including
111/999 calls and 111-online.</p>

<h3>Top 25 CCG</h3>
<p>These plots show the 25 CGGs with the most increases in the last 7 days. Future
versions will provide plots for all CCGs.</p>
