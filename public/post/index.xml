      <description>Using the new algorithm ASMODEE (Automatic Selection of Models and Outlier Detection for Epidemics) we monitor changes in potential COVID-19 cases reported through the NHS pathways, including calls to 111, 999, and 111-online. These analyses are broken down by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG). Only the last 6 weeks of data are used. The last week of data is not used to define the temporal trend so that recent outliers can be detected.</description>
